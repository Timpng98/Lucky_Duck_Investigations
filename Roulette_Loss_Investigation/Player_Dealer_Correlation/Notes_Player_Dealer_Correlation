After looking at the data, the 2 people who are colluding to scam Lucky Duck Casino, are Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones.
After gathering all the evidence and filtering out the losses into a seperate file, discovered that there were a total 
of 13 losses between all 3 days, March 10,12, and 15. Using a script, looking at when the losses occured and which Dealer was 
working roulette, the one name that was frequent was Billy Jones. The result is located in Dealer_working_during_losses folder. 
Looking at the days for which players are present during the losses, the name that was always playing during those times 
was Mylie Schmidt. The results are located in the file Roulette_Losses. The losses ranged between $65,348 - $182,419.
In conclusion, the same dealer and player working and playing together speciifically when the losses occured is odd and should 
be looked into.
